# WP-REST-API-Single-Page-Application-Test
Testing out the WP API, using JavaScript, jQuery, and not much else.

Not sure if this needs a detailed readme, but I need the practice.

Purpose: To build an acceptable, single-page blog app utilizing the WP REST API. I copied the database from my old DIY blog (http://www.heavilyedited.com/blog/) to use as test content.

The initial upload is most definitely flawed. The whole point of this is to track my progress.
